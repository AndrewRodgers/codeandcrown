                </header>
                <p>When The Kauffman Foundation decided to implement a new publishing strategy for their website, they needed a new digital format that could solve some unique challenges it would pose for their content authors. Their vision demanded the consolidation of many seemingly disparate content types (everything from press-releases to long-form editorial pieces) along with a need to display this content in a visually compelling yet cohesive manner. Our answer was to reach for a very specific UX / Design pattern that we knew would be up to the challenge: The Card Pattern.</p>

                <p>With a vast array of varied layout elements  and aesthetics, the unassuming Card Pattern would allow for <em>just enough</em> structured data to help content authors publish quickly, but also provide a strong foundation for unique content-first grid layouts. With an improved authoring experience, choices could be allowed for the fine-tuning of importance, weight, and visual hierarchy allowing the construction of an impactful “Featured Story Card” area <em>and</em> a browsable, dynamically-driven gallery of topic-based cards.</p>

        <section class="article_content article_content--bottom">
            <p>Each card was made up of shared meta-data: accompanying media (images, videos, patterns, etc.), short- and long-titles, descriptions, calls-to-action, and date-driven flags (such as “new”, “featured content”, etc.) so that no matter the original source, each card could be created within the CMS by simply choosing the appropriate card format (video, image, quote, etc.), a size based on importance and choosing a recently published story. From there a content author could tweak as needed; whether cropping a thumbnail for optimal placement, or word-smithing the perfect lead.</p>

        <section class="article_content article_content--bottom">
            <p>To compliment this new landing page, we also helped redesign the Currents’ shared “Detail Page” developing a solution that would allow for anything from a short video writeup to a data-visualization deep-dive to be the editorial focus, while also helping to promote longer page-views and context-setting in-page story-to-story way finding, allowing an end-user to see the bigger picture and understand the shared themes across stories.</p>
            <p>The end product was <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/currents">The Kauffman Foundation’s Currents Landing page</a> which helped organized the wide variety of content being centrally published into one cohesive page that could be used to thematically group “Featured Story Cards” or allow the end-user to quickly browse content by topics.</p>
