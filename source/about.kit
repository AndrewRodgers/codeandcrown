                <p>I’ve been working for over 15 years in the user-experience, design, and front-end development space, to help my clients build feature-rich and user-centered websites and digital experiences.</p>

                <p>A few things I’m passionate about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Semantic code;</li>
                    <li>Problem-solving through design;</li>
                    <li>Accessibility and web standards;</li>
                    <li>User-driven (and tested) feature planning, design, and development;</li>
                    <li>Fallout bobbleheads (sadly, I own over a dozen)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I’m currently employed as a Senior UX Designer at Velir, where I have the privilege to work with some of the world’s best-known institutions, including AARP, Brookings, Educause, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Kauffman Foundation, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Yale. I’ve also worked with a number of Fortune 500 companies, including Samsung, PepsiCo, and Unilever.</p>

                <p>I currently live in North Carolina with my wife, son, and two cats. When I’m not shackled to my computer monitor, I enjoy exploring the area in search of the best craft beer and ramen.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere you can find me on LinkedIn, Dribbble, and Github.</p>
